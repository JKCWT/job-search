        "description": "<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today, Cloudflare runs one of the world’s largest distributed networks that powers more than 1.5 trillion page views each month across 6.5 million Internet properties. More than 10 percent of all global Internet requests flow through Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our team is hard at work shaping the future of the Internet by solving some of its toughest challenges. We believe in solving real problems by granting individuals and teams ownership and autonomy. If you want to make the Internet better by working with talented coworkers to solve hard problems at scale, Cloudflare is where you belong.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Department</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloudflare Apps is building the next billion-dollar app marketplace from the ground up. Rather than mobile phones, our apps get installed onto Cloudflare-powered websites. Visit </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cloudflare.com/apps\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://cloudflare.com/apps</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to preview apps and try your hand at building one.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way tools are installed onto websites and Internet properties is outdated. We believe an engineer should be able to build and monetize the next great analytics, security, or even e-commerce solution and offer it to millions of sites overnight.  If what she builds is the best solution, it should be possible for her to make millions of dollars too.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make that dream possible we’ve built more than just a listing of apps. Cloudflare Apps can be customized, previewed, and installed onto any site in the Cloudflare network securely and reliably. Our aim is to make it possible for Cloudflare Apps to control every aspect of a request, and for the platform to be beloved across the Internet — from personal blogs to the world’s largest enterprises.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a member of our growing team of engineers your responsibilities include:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ship product features to the millions of sites which use Cloudflare every day.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be an entrepreneur and a visionary for your portion of the platform. Take responsibility for ensuring that what you build delights customers and achieves the goals of the team and the organization.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write in any or all of Javascript, CSS, and Go, based on your interest and experience.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work with talented peers by submitting and reviewing pull requests, engaging in design discussions, and teaming up to tackle new projects.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advocate for how the product and the team can work better.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members of our team are responsible for:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building APIs which are both simple and powerful allowing app developers to build tools utilizing more of Cloudflare and more of the web browser.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving the experience of installing a Cloudflare App. This includes tools like our Live App Preview, our app listing, ratings, reviews and app recommendations.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating tools and dashboards to support app creators. This includes tools for app creators to get more feedback from users, to get analytics on their app’s success, and to have a better experience creating and debugging their apps.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working with app creators to see that their apps are easy to use, well designed, and secure.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building open source projects to share what we learn and share the power and value of Cloudflare Apps.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key Competencies</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are user-focused and thrive in a fast-paced and goal-driven environment. You consider building reliable and capable software to be just the first step in solving user problems. You are confident building software which works reliably because you’ve made many of the mistakes already. You’d rather ship than overengineer. You have a passion for growing yourself and your teammates and always have your sights set on getting better. You strive to have a positive impact and leave a positive impression on everyone you meet. You want to be a part of building something you can be proud of.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This job can adapt to your knowledge and interest in backend development, frontend development, design, and growth.

Our vision is driven by a belief that the Internet should be fair and open to all. Without the protection of Cloudflare thousands of sites, including many non-profits, would not be able to stay online. We not only provide our highest level of protection free to many of these advocacy and human rights organizations, we also provide a free tier of service to every site on the Internet which choses to use Cloudflare. If you believe in a free and open Internet, Cloudflare is the right place for you.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This job is available in both Austin, TX and San Francisco, CA.

The ideal candidate thrives in a fast-paced environment and has the ability to grasp complex software engineering concepts and learn new technologies quickly. As a Software Engineer at Kinnser Software you will work as a member of a Scrum team to architect, build, and test the latest features and enhancements to our software. You will work in an environment that emphasizes collaboration, automation, and performance.  You will require little management because you can solve most problems on your own and know how to effectively communicate with peers and various stakeholders.   <br><br><strong>What You’ll be doing:</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a developer, you’ll be playing a key role in building large-scale public-facing, high-volume web applications. You will architect, plan, and build new systems that are high performing and well tested. At Kinnser, we’re not afraid of change and improvement. That’s why we expect you to make recommendations for automation improvements and actually implement these recommendations. You’ll also perform code reviews, and you will write unit and integration tests. We’ll also help to develop you as an engineer; we’ll provide you with the tools and education to ensure your growth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What we’re looking for:<br><br></strong>Our engineering team is made up of really smart and diverse team members, but we all share the same goal, and that is to make applications that are functional and easy to use for healthcare professionals. We’re looking for seasoned developers with a very analytical mindset. Our most successful new hires tend to have already been working a number of years doing front-end and server-side web development. You should also not be a novice to JavaScript.  Hopefully you’ve been mastering the craft a few years now. We use Github, so version control software experience is going to be a major plus for us. We run an Agile shop.  It’s important to us that you have an understanding of this as well as software development principals. We have a highly collaborative culture, and we’re always learning from each other, but don’t be surprised if you have to work on a solo project from time to time.<br><br><strong>Experience and qualities that we’re definitely interested in: <br><br></strong> • AngularJS (Single Page Applications) <br>• NodeJS <br>• REST API development <br>• Experience writing tests and doing automation <br>• Experience with extremely large, high-traffic, OLTP databases <br>• Experience with SQL and NoSQL<br>• You've worked in the healthcare industry <br>• JSON</p>\n\n<p>• Strong .NET skills</p>\n\n<p><strong>About Kinnser  <br><br></strong>We deliver easy-to-use, agency management software backed by our top-rated services teams. Our mission is to help our customers provide the best in patient care and thrive as businesses.  Today, we focus on hospice as well as home health and are planning to work across the post-acute care continuum.  Headquartered in Austin, Texas, we serve more than 3,000 agencies across the US, and we’re recognized as one of the fastest growing tech companies by Inc 500 Magazine. We know great products and service start with great people, and we’re proud to be named a “Top Place to Work” in the annual Austin American Statesman workplace survey. With Kinnser’s point of care solutions, home health and hospice agencies can more effectively manage their scheduling, billing, compliance, electronic visit verification, and physician referrals. </p>",
